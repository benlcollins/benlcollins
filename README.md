# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an educator, writer and developer at [benlcollins.com](https://www.benlcollins.com/), and founder of [The Collins School of Data](https://courses.benlcollins.com/) and [SheetsCon](https://sheetscon.com/), the online conference for all things Google Sheets.

I publish long-form tutorials  and courses about working with data in Google Sheets, Apps Script, Google Tables and Data Studio.

Since 2017 Iâ€™ve released 10 online video courses teaching over 30,000 professionals how to use spreadsheets, work with data and learn how to program.

In 2019, Google awarded me the Google Developer Expert title for Google Workspace technology.

I'm currently building data pipelines using BigQuery, Google Sheets, Apps Script and Data Studio.
