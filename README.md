# Hello! 👋

I’m an educator, writer and developer at [benlcollins.com](https://www.benlcollins.com/) and founder of [The Collins School of Data](https://courses.benlcollins.com/).

I publish long-form tutorials  and courses about working with data in Google Sheets, Apps Script, Google Tables and Data Studio.

Since 2017 I’ve released 10 online video courses teaching over 50,000 professionals how to use spreadsheets, work with data and learn how to program.

In 2019, Google awarded me the Google Developer Expert award for Google Workspace technology.

I also teach a live training cohort course, Pro Sheets, designed for early- to mid-career knowledge workers who want to get up to speed as quickly as possible on data analysis and automation concepts within Google Sheets.
